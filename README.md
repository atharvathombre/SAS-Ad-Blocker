# SAS-Ad-Blocker

This is a google chrome extension for AD-blocking. As we know, there are many advertising firms like Zeto which display ADs on our favorite websites, so to block
these ADs, we first must block the connections from our browser to the advertising firms. To block these requests, I used google chrome APIs. With these APIs,
the connection is blocked and then no ADs are displayed.
